// Message Passing to Transfer data between threads
// To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rustâ€™s standard library provides an implementation of channels. A channel is a general programming concept by which data is sent from one thread to another.
// The Rust standard library provides an implementation of channels for message passing concurrency. A channel is a way to send a value from one thread to another. One part of the channel, the sender, sends a value, and the other part, the receiver, receives the value.
// A Channel has two halves: the transmitter and the receiver. 
// The transmitter half is used to send a message, and the receiver half is used to receive a message.

// Collections: Collections are used to store multiple values in a single data structure. The standard library provides several collection types, such as:
//    * Vectors: A growable array. Vectors are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single data structure.
//    * Strings: A collection of characters
//    * Hash maps: A collection of key-value pairs
